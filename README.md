Management: Ensures that changes to requirements are properly handled and communicated.

7. Principles Of Software Design :
   Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
   Modularity in software design refers to the practice of breaking down a software system into smaller, independent modules or components, each responsible for a specific functionality or feature. These modules are designed to be cohesive internally, meaning that they perform a single, well-defined task, and loosely coupled with each other, meaning that they have minimal dependencies on other modules.

How Modularity Improves Maintainability and Scalability:
Encapsulation of Complexity: Modularity allows developers to encapsulate the complexity of a system within individual modules. Each module hides its internal implementation details, exposing only a well-defined interface to other modules. This makes the system easier to understand and maintain, as developers can focus on one module at a time without being overwhelmed by the entire system's complexity.

Isolation of Changes: With a modular design, changes made to one module have minimal impact on other modules. This is because modules are loosely coupled, meaning that they interact with each other through well-defined interfaces rather than directly accessing each other's internal details. As a result, developers can modify or replace one module without affecting the functionality of the rest of the system, making it easier to adapt the system to changing requirements or technologies.

Reuse of Components: Modular design promotes code reuse by allowing developers to create reusable components that can be used in multiple parts of the system. When a common functionality is needed in different modules, developers can implement it once in a separate module and then use it wherever necessary. This reduces redundancy and duplication of code, leading to a more maintainable and efficient codebase.

Scalability: Modularity facilitates the scalability of software systems by allowing them to be easily extended or modified to accommodate growth or changes in requirements. New features or functionalities can be implemented as separate modules, which can be integrated into the existing system without disrupting its overall structure. This enables the system to evolve over time without requiring a complete overhaul, making it more adaptable to changing business needs or user demands.

8. Testing in Software Engineering:
   Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
   Unit Testing: Testing individual components of the software to verify their correct functionality.
Scope: Focuses on the smallest parts of the code, like functions or classes.
Techniques: Utilizes automated testing frameworks to test each unit independently.
Purpose: Detects defects early and ensures each unit performs as expected.

Integration Testing:Testing interactions between integrated components to ensure they work together properly.
Scope: Evaluates how different modules interact and communicate.
Techniques: Uses both top-down and bottom-up approaches to gradually integrate and test modules.
Purpose: Validates integration points and ensures the system functions as a cohesive unit.

System Testing: Testing the entire software system to verify compliance with requirements and overall functionality.
Scope: Examines the system as a whole, including all integrated components and external interfaces.
Techniques: Encompasses functional, performance, security, and usability testing.
Purpose: Confirms the system meets user expectations and business requirements.

Acceptance Testing:Testing to determine if the software meets acceptance criteria and is ready for deployment.
Scope: Tests from the end-user perspective, focusing on user workflows and business processes.
Techniques: Includes alpha and beta testing, as well as user acceptance testing.
Purpose: Validates the software's readiness for production use and its alignment with user needs.
